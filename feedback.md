# Feedback on Project Work

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 6

Brian, I think you have a fairly complete paper here. One thing I would suggest is just some light editing, but beyond that I would also suggest that you try to break up some of the paragraphs into reasonable sections. There's clearly an introduction and background sections, but then it appears you might also have a section where you discuss separate from the general model how different forms of magnetism come about (starting with, "from a theoretical standpoint..."). I think there's still a question of the conclusion for the paper, which the last paragraph doesn't seem to serve that purpose precisely, so you will need to think about how to bring everything together at the end. But overall, I think you are very close to a complete paper. Great work over the last 6 weeks.

## Assignment 5

Brian, this is a great update. It addresses a lot of the concerns that I had about explaning the quantum model and the underlying assumptions it makes. I'm curious where you want to go frmo here because what you have done is provide a basis of understnading a quantum model of magnetism and offered some connection to temperature dependence. I think to make this a full paper, you will to think about the organizational struture and narrative that you will present and how what you have here fits in as a meat of the paper. I also am curious is some figures (don't have to be original if referenced) might help you strengthen the piece you have written here where you can provide some additional information about the models. Great job.

## Assignment 3

Brian, great summaries again. Also, it's completely fine to change the papers as you go along. You start to learn more about the field that you are working in and you begin to decide what is more important to review. I appreciated the note at the end, which I think recognized the feedback that I gave you last week. As you go to form your synthesis across your papers for your homework this week, I'll be looking for you to do exactly what you are suggesting: explaining how the quantum mechanical model gives rise to magnetism and how we might contrast it with the classical decsription. Great work.

## Assignment 2

Brian, this is a great summary of this dense paper. Your summary does leave me wondering about a few things that I'm hoping that you address in your readings and paper. The model that you are describing is a fundamentally quantum mechanical model (i.e., it uses spin and spin coupling to describe the phenomenon). So I wonder how do we formulate magnetism in such a model? That is, how does this Hamiltonian formulation (i.e., a quantum mechanical energy relationship) give rise to magnetism? What is magnetism in this sense? Think about the classical model where what we say is that a current makes a magnetic field, so any moving charge will generate a magnetic field in a classical sense. So what is the equivalent statement for this model. That is, what is the thing in the model (entity, interaction, etc.) that gives rise to the magnetic field? This level of conceptual detail is important for understanding the rest of the model (i.e., how energy minimization and temperature affect magnetic interactions). Again, good work so far, but I'll be looking for you to take these papers to build a complete paper describing the phenomenon. I know that it's easy to present what is told to you, but it's harder to synthesize across it and explain it simply. I'm asking you to try to do the latter.

## Assignment 1

Brian, I think that your proposed research topic is very much fitting with the intent of this project. I'm glad that you are using this as a way to deepen your understanding of the field in which you are currently conducting research. In reviewing the articles that you posted, I think you have chosen a set of pedagogocially sound articles (i.e., ones that will help you deepen this understanding). However, they are quite long and for Friday, I'm asking that you summarize 2 articles. My suggestion for you is to try to read through 2 articles, but that you perhaps summarize just one of the longer articles for this first part of the project. I think the article from NTNU and/or chapter 5 of the lecture notes would be reasonable to start, but you probably want to read the first 4 chapters of those lecutre notes at some point as well. Great work getting started.
