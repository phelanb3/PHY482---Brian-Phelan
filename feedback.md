In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 2

Brian, this is a great summar of this dense paper. Your summary does leave me wondering about a few things that I'm hoping that you address in your readings and paper. The model that you are describing is a fundamentally quantum mechanical model (i.e., it uses spin and spin coupling to describe the phenomenon). So I wonder how do we formulate magnetism in such a model? THat is, how does this Hamiltonian formulation (i.e., a quantum mechanical energy relationship) give rise to magnetism? What is magnetism in this sense? Think about he classical model where what we say is that a current makes a magnetic field, so any moving charge will generate a magnetic field in a classical sense. So what is the equivalent statement for this model. That is, what is the thing in the model (entity, interaction, etc.) that gives rise to the magnetic field? This level of conceptual detail is important for understanding the rest of the model (i.e., how energy minimization and temperature affect magnetic interactions). Again, good work so far, but I'll be looking for you to take these papers to build a complete paper describing the phenomenon. I know that it's easy to present what is told to you, but it's harder to synthesize across it and explain it simply. I'm asking you to try to do the latter.

## Assignment 1

Brian, I think that your proposed research topic is very much fitting with the intent of this project. I'm glad that you are using this as a way to deepen your understanding of the field in which you are currently conducting research. In reviewing the articles that you posted, I think you have chosen a set of pedagogocially sound articles (i.e., ones that will help you deepen this understanding). However, they are quite long and for Friday, I'm asking that you summarize 2 articles. My suggestion for you is to try to read through 2 articles, but that you perhaps summarize just one of the longer articles for this first part of the project. I think the article from NTNU and/or chapter 5 of the lecture notes would be reasonable to start, but you probably want to read the first 4 chapters of those lecutre notes at some point as well. Great work getting started.
