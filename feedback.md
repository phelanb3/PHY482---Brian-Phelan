## Assignment 1

Brian, I think that your proposed research topic is very much fitting with the intent of this project. I'm glad that you are using this as a way to deepen your understanding of the field in which you are currently conducting research. In revieweing the articles that you posted, I think you have chosen a set of pedagogocially sound articles (i.e., ones that will help you deepen this understanding). However, they are quite long and for Friday, I'm asking that you summarize 2 articles. My suggestion for you is to try to read through 2 articles, but that you perhaps summarize just one of the longer articles for this first part of the project. I think the article from NTNU and/or chapter 5 of the lecture notes would be reasonable to start, but you probably want to read the first 4 chapters of those lecutre notes at some point as well. Great work getting started.

* Score: 20/20
